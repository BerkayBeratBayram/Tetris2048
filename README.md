# Tetris2048
Tetris2048 is a desktop game developed in Java, combining the core mechanics of both Tetris and 2048.
The player strategically places falling blocks to merge identical numbers and earn points — blending Tetris’s fast-paced reflex gameplay with the logical progression of 2048.

The game is fully designed following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
The code structure consists of classes such as Grid, Tile, Tetrominoes, and Tetris2048.
The graphical interface and user interactions are implemented using Java Swing/AWT libraries.

Core features include a game loop, collision detection, merge algorithm, and score management system.
This project serves as a clear and efficient example for anyone looking to understand OOP concepts through an engaging and interactive game.
